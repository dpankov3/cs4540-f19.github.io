**Communication**

We will be using Piazza for managing questions about lecture material, homeworks, and course logistics.  Please only send us email in the event of a personal emergency or other sensitive matter.  If you email us about anything else, we will likely request that you open a Piazza post.  (Note that you can make private posts on Piazza to avoid revealing homework solutions publicly.)

## Course Description

This is an advanced course on algorithms. That is quite a broad topic, and in particular this semester’s course will focus heavily on **algorithms for machine learning**. We will be especially interested in diving into the following topics:

* Numerical Analysis
* Convex Geometry & Optimization
* Probability & Statistical Inference

While students should have a strong back background in core algorithmic concepts, linear algebra, calculus, and probability, we will review many of these topics early in the course. Students will be required to write code in Python, and we will present much of the material in the course using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).

## Hands-on Format

In most courses, students learn about material in class through lecture, and then they practice problem solving on their own by doing homework.  In this course we will do the opposite! Students will be required to read material before each class period, and then arrive in class ready to dive into problem-solving.  This way, students can familiarize themselves with basic definitions and examples at home, and benefit from one-on-one interaction with the course staff during lecture while working through more challenging aspects of the material.  Lecture notes for each day will be posted online at least one week prior to each lecture (with the first week as an exception).

Why do it like this? The lecture format is an outdated way to teach mathematical material, especially for topics such as algorithms and machine learning where it is so easy to play with code and implement ideas. The lecture format also limits the professor’s ability to interact directly with students.

Each class period will have the following structure:

* *(0mins)* Students arrive and organize themselves by sitting with their group
* *(5mins)* Students take a very short and simple quiz on assigned reading material
* *(70mins)* Problem time! Instructor presents a sequence of problems, and students are given 5-10 minutes per problem to try to solve each one with their group. Instructors will move around the classroom to engage with students and answer questions.


## Grading

### Homeworks (35%)

Students are allowed, and indeed encouraged, to work on homework with other students in the course. But when solutions are written up, this should be done alone and without the help of other students. Students are required to specify on their writeups which students that collaborated with. If we find solutions that appear even remotely to have been copied, these will be given a zero and the students will be notified.

### Attendance+Quizzes (15%)

In-class quizzes will be graded generously, and 50% of the credit will be given simply for showing up.  Quizzes will be entered electronically, via a web form, so make sure you have a phone, laptop, or tablet with you in class!  If you don't have access to any of these, please let us know and we will make accomodations.  The grading scheme for quizzes will be:

* 2 points for a correct answer
* 1 point for an incorrect answer
* 0 points for not taking the quiz

Your **five lowest quiz scores will be dropped**, which should be enough to account for quizzes missed due to planned or unplanned absences.

### Midterm Exam (20%)

The date of the midterm is TBD.  More details about the topics and format will be released at a later date.

### Final Exam (30%)

The final exam will take place on **Thursday, December 5, 2019** from **2:40-5:30pm**.  The final exam date is fixed by the university, and we are not at liberty to change it.
